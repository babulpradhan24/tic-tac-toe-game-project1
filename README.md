# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game in Python

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic‚ÄëTac‚ÄëToe game built using Python. It supports a two-player mode (Player X vs Player O) and includes game state display, win checking, and draw detection.

## üß† Game Logic

- The game board is represented by two lists: one for Player X and one for Player O.
- Players take turns to input their moves.
- After every move, the program checks for:
  - A **win** (3 aligned symbols),
  - A **draw** (all cells filled with no winner).
- The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.
